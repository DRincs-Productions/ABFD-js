# Pixi'VN

Pixi'VN is a npm package that provides various features for creating visual novels.

Pixi'VN has functions to manage story steps, saving and loading, variable storage, dialogues, and character creation.

Pixi'VN is based on Pixi.js, a modern 2D rendering engine, expanding the features by adding a save and load system, and functions to simplify the addition of images and animations.

In addition to managing the Pixi.js "Canvas", Pixi'VN offers the possibility of adding an HTML Element with the same dimensions as the "Canvas" to add interactions with the user.
This allows the use of systems such as React, Vue, Angular, etc. to create much more complex interfaces with excellent performance.
