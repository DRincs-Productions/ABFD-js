# Contributing Guidelines

*Pull requests, bug reports, and all other forms of contribution are welcomed and highly encouraged!* :octocat:

Before opening a new issue/discussion, please try to respect the following rules:

* **Do not open a duplicate issue/discussion!** Search through existing issues to see if your issue has previously been reported. If your issue exists, comment with any additional information you have. You may simply note "I have this problem too", which helps prioritize the most common problems and requests. 
* **Prefer using [reactions](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)**, not comments, if you simply want to "+1" an existing issue.
* Before creating an issue, check if you are using the latest version of the project. If you are not up-to-date, see if updating fixes your issue first.

## :beetle: Bug Reports and Other Issues

A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed issue when you encounter a problem. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report. :v: You can report a problem by creating an issue [here](https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/pixi-vn/issues/new).

## :bulb: Asking Questions

Need help? Or have a doubt? You can ask on Discord (find the invitation on the main [site](https://pixi-vn.web.app/)) or start a new discussion [here](https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/pixi-vn/discussions/new?category=q-a).

## :love_letter: Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome! While we will consider all requests, we cannot guarantee your request will be accepted. We want to avoid [feature creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep). Your idea may be great, but also out-of-scope for the project. If accepted, we cannot make any commitments regarding the timeline for implementation and release.

You can create a new discussion [here](https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/pixi-vn/discussions/new?category=ideas), also specify if you want to help with implementation or not.

You can find a list of pending "features to implement" [here](https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/pixi-vn/discussions/categories/pixi-vn-needs-help).

Or you can apply by creating a thread [here](https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/pixi-vn/discussions/new?category=pixi-vn-needs-help), where you introduce yourself and list your expertise.

## üî® Development

Before implementing any kind of change it is recommended to talk to the developers first, in order to get more guidance on how to achieve what you have in mind.

pixi-vn is not a huge project and the code should be quite understandable (apart from the management of Tickers).

The project is divided into the following folders:
